# react-native-honors-app

##This React Native App is coded to push the hardware just far enough to be able to test the same app written in Swift.

This app includes Facebook profile retrieval, To Do List, Page View Controller (Carousel, and Geolocation.

I have coded the exact same app using Swift. I will be pitting these apps against eachother to see which one performs better.

I will be using Apple Instruments to examine the behavior of the apps, perform profiling in a simulator, create custom DTrace instruments to analyze aspects of system and app behavior, track down problems in my source code, conduct performance analysis on these apps, find memory problems in the apps (such as leaks, abandoned memory, and zombies), identify ways to optimize the apps for greater power efficiency, and perform general system-level troubleshooting.

# To run this app. 
-clone this app onto your computer
-cd into directory
-type "yarn" on the terminal and press ENTER. (If you don't have Yarn, get it. It's faster and more reliable than npm [in my opinion]. 
-Now, type "react-native run-ios" and press ENTER and you should be cruisin'!
